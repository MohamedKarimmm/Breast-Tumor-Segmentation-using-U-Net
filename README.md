# Breast Tumor Segmentation using U-Net

A Deep Learning-based medical image segmentation project for breast tumor region extraction from mammogram images using the U-Net architecture.

---

## Overview

This project focuses on breast tumor segmentation from medical mammogram images using U-Net, a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks.

The system predicts pixel-level masks to accurately highlight tumor regions in breast images.

---

## Objective

The main goal of the project is to automatically segment suspicious tumor regions from mammogram images to assist in early breast cancer diagnosis.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains:

* Mammogram Images
* Corresponding Mask Images

Each mask represents the exact tumor region in the image.

The dataset was divided into:

* Training Set
* Validation Set
* Test Set

---

## Model Architecture

The project uses the U-Net architecture which consists of:

* Encoder (Downsampling)
* Bottleneck
* Decoder (Upsampling)
* Skip Connections

This structure helps preserve important spatial features for accurate segmentation.

---

## Preprocessing

Applied preprocessing techniques including:

* Image resizing
* Normalization
* Mask preprocessing
* Data augmentation

to improve segmentation performance.

---

## Training

The model was trained using:

* Binary Cross Entropy Loss
* Adam Optimizer
* GPU acceleration

The model learns to generate segmentation masks for tumor regions.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The segmentation model was evaluated using:

* Dice Coefficient
* IoU (Intersection over Union)
* Accuracy

The model achieved strong segmentation performance on validation and test images.

---

## Results

The system successfully generated segmentation masks highlighting tumor regions in mammogram images with high accuracy.

Predicted masks closely matched the ground truth masks.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* U-Net
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
